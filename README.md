# Ingenio Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.

FYI: I've added a setTimeout of 2 seconds to simulate fetching data from a server.

## Installing dependencies

After cloning the repo you need to access the folder locally and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` or run `ng serve -o` to open the url automatically in your default browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
